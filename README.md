## About

Dataset: [FIFA 19 Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karangadiya/fifa19)

The order of our notebook is: 

  1. Introduction
  2. Data Cleaning 
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis 
  4. Machine Learning 
  5. Conclusion & Takeaways

## Problem Definition 

  - For a GoalKeeper, which Goalkeeping attribute contributes most to his overall rating? Predict the overall rating of goalkeepers with that attribute 
  - For each Non-Goalkeeping Position, which non-physical attribute contributes most to each of their overall rating? Predict the overall ratings of each non-goalkeeping position players with just their respective highest correlated attribute.

## Models Used 

  1. Linear Regression 
  2. Decision Tree Regressor 
  3. Random Forest 

## Conclusion 

  - GKReflexes is the buggest predictor of GoalKeeper overall rating 
  - Positioning is the biggest predictor for Attacker overall rating
  - Composure and vision are the biggest predictor for midfielder overall rating
  - Interceptions is the biggest predictor for defender overall rating
  - Random Forest model is best at predicting overall rating

## Takeaways 
  - Random Forest from sklearn
  - Linear Regression from sklearn 
  - Decision Tree Regressor from sklearn 
  - Data Visualisation from plotly
  - Github collaboration
  - Learn to compare and utilise different models to suit our needs for prediction
